    <h2><i>You're All I Need</i></h2>
    <p>
   [Verse 1]<br>
I know that she's waiting<br>
For me to say forever<br>
I know that I sometimes<br>
Just don't know how to tell her<br>
I want to hold and kiss her<br>
Give her my love<br>
Make her believe<br>
She doesn't know<br>
She doesn't know<br>
</p>
<p>
[Chorus]<br>
You're all I need beside me, girl!<br>
You're all I need to turn my world<br>
You're all I want inside my heart<br>
You're all I need when we're apart<br>
</p>
<p>
[Post-Chorus]<br>
You're all that I need<br>
Yeah!<br>
</p>
<p>
[Verse 2]<br>
I know that she's always<br>
There when I need her loving<br>
I know that I never<br>
Told her how much I love her<br>
I see her face before me<br>
I look in her eyes<br>
Just wondering why<br>
She doesn't know<br>
She doesn't know<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
She doesn't know<br>
</p>
<p>
[Chorus]<br>
You're all I need beside me, girl!<br>
You're all I need to turn my world<br>
You're all I want inside my heart<br>
You're all I need when we're apart<br>
</p>
<p>
[Bridge]<br>
Say<br>
Say that you'll be there<br>
Whenever I reach out<br>
To feel your hand in mine<br>
Stay<br>
Stay within my heart<br>
Whenever I'm alone<br>
I know that you are there<br>
Oooooh!<br>
</p>
<p>
[Chorus]<br>
You're all I need beside me, girl!<br>
You're all I need to turn my world<br>
You're all I want inside my heart<br>
You're all I need when we're apart<br>
You're all I need beside me, girl!<br>
All that I need<br>
All I need to turn my world<br>
All that I need beside me, girl!<br>
You're all I want inside my heart<br>
You're all I need when we're apart<br>
</p>
<p>
[Outro]<br>
All that I need<br>
Is for you to believe<br>
All that I need<br>
Is you<br>
