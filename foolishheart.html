    <h2><i>Foolish Heart</i></h2>
<p>
[Verse 1]<br>
I need a love that grows<br>
I don't want it unless I know<br>
That each passing hour, someone somehow<br>
Will be there, ready to share<br>
I need a love that's strong<br>
I'm so tired of being alone<br>
But will my lonely heart play the part<br>
Of the fool again? Before I begin<br>
</p>
<p>
[Chorus]<br>
Foolish heart, hear me calling<br>
Stop before you start falling<br>
Foolish heart, heed my warning<br>
You've been wrong before<br>
Don't be wrong anymore<br>
</p>
<p>
[Verse 2]<br>
Feeling that feeling again<br>
I'm playing a game I can't win<br>
Love's knocking on the door of my heart once more<br>
Think I'll let her in, before I begin<br>
</p>
<p>
[Chorus]<br>
Foolish heart, hear me calling<br>
Stop before you start falling<br>
Foolish heart, heed my warning<br>
You've been wrong before<br>
Don't be wrong anymore<br>
</p>
<p>
[Post-Chorus]<br>
Foolish heart<br>
Foolish, foolish heart<br>
You've been wrong before<br>
</p>
<p>
[Breakdown]<br>
Foolish<br>
Foolish<br>
</p>
<p>
[Chorus]<br>
Foolish heart, hear me calling<br>
Stop before you start falling<br>
Foolish heart, heed my warning<br>
You've been wrong before<br>
Don't be wrong anymore<br>
</p>
<p>
[Post-Chorus]<br>
Foolish heart<br>
Oh, foolish, foolish heart<br>
You've been wrong before<br>
</p>
<p>
[Outro]<br>
Foolish, foolish heart<br>
Foolish heart<br>
